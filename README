phpBrainz is a PHP library for accessing MusicBrainz (http://musicbrainz.org), an online database with huge amounts of data on recorded music. It is modeled after python-musicbrainz2, the next-generation MusicBrainz library for python and the reference implementation created by the MusicBrainz project itself.

Approximate usage is to require phpBrainz.class.php and then with a shiny new phpBrainz() object, pull out some ->getTrack(), ->getRelease(), ->findTrack(), and ->findRelease() magic. Soon to come is an additional ->getArtist(). The code should, however, be relatively understandable, and the examples in the cleverly-named examples/ directory will additionally supplement your learning.

phpBrainz was originally written by Jeff Sherlock (olds on GitHub) but this file and some recent changes have been made by Ian McEwen (ianmcorvidae).

Enjoy!
